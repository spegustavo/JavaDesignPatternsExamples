/*
 * Proxy design pattern intent according to GoF is: 
 * Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control 
 * access to it. 
 * The definition itself is very clear and proxy design pattern is used
 * when we want to provide controlled access of a functionality. 
 * Let’s say we have a class that can run some command on the system.
 * Now if we are using it, its fine but if we want to give this 
 * program to a client application, it can have severe issues 
 * because client program can issue command to delete some system 
 * files or change some settings that you don’t want. Here a proxy 
 * class can be created to provide controlled access of the program.
